sentence=Display driver for SSD1306.
paragraph=This is an extremely lite weight display driver for screens with the SSD1306. This library has one font and one font size. A drawing method is also included for drawing images. Displays that do not send data back to the device lack the ACK bit and may need a special library, so this was supposedly created by the manufacturer. I have made a few minor modifications for easier readability and use.
